## 📊 Status
Currently the status of the project is very incomplete, is in a very early stage, where the structure and logic are still being designed.
Things can change quickly and drastically, resulting in breaking changes.

## ❔ Why
This framework is made to complement the projects we carry out as a complete web development framework tailored to our needs.

It originates from the need to have a global context where all the internal logic that a "webapp" needs was handled (such as a login method, router ... etc)

## 🧰 Features
- ⚙️ **Flexible environment**, allows to set advance configuration to the framework, including support with base configuration API of ViteJS.
- 🧱 **Extensible**, easily extend the global App context with custom extensions.
- 🗄 **Libraries & Components**, it has a library for common use that contains components and libraries to use within a project. It can also be managed by corenode package manager.
- 📦 **Out of the box**, evite contains built-in multiple libraries and extensions, (As development server, build server, live serve ...etc)
- 🛳 Integration with Corenode, including all its benefits as backend.
- 📈 All ViteJS benefits and features.
- 🔌 100% Compatible with ViteJS plugins.
